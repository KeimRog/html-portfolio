        <h1>The Best Movies According to Rodgers</h1>
        <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
        <hr/>
        <h3>Treason</h3>
        <p>It's a spy story with a lot of nasty and corrupt forces that put the protagonists into almost impossible corners. The last half of the series has acts of courage and desperation to achieve at least an honorable conclusion to a very messed up situation.</p>
        <h3>The Oval</h3>
        <p>Head butler Richard Hallsen is an ex-serviceman who struggles to maintain his integrity in the face of greed and corruption. In "The Oval," Tyler Perry supercharges the political genre with off-the-charts levels of scandal, sex, depravity and betrayal</p>
        <h3>21 Bridges</h3>
        <p>This is a thrilling and suspenseful police drama, that will keep you glued to the screen as Boseman chase down a couple of thieves</p>
